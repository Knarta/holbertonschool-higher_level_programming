## Requirements ‚úÖ
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks üìã
### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing ‚ûï
- This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative:
  - You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative.py)
  - The variable `number` will store a different value every time you will run this program
  - You don‚Äôt have to understand what `import`, `random.randint` do. Please do not touch this code
  - The output of the program should be:
    - The number, followed by
    - if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
    - if the number is 0: `is zero`
    - if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    - followed by a new line

#### Example:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import random
number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)
# ...existing code...
if number > 0:
    print("{} is positive".format(number))
elif number == 0:
    print("{} is zero".format(number))
else:
    print("{} is negative".format(number))
# Output:
# -4 is negative
# 0 is zero
# 10 is positive
```

### 1. The last digit üî¢
- This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`:
  - You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit.py)
  - The variable `number` will store a different value every time you will run this program
  - You don‚Äôt have to understand what `import`, `random.randint` do. Please do not touch this code. This line should not change: `number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)`
  - The output of the program should be:
    - The string `Last digit of`, followed by
    - the number, followed by
    - the string `is`, followed by the last digit of `number`, followed by
    - if the last digit is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
    - if the last digit is 0: the string `and is 0`
    - if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
    - followed by a new line

#### Example:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import random
number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)
# ...existing code...
last_digit = abs(number) % 10
if number < 0:
    last_digit = -last_digit
print("Last digit of {} is {} and is ".format(number, last_digit), end="")
if last_digit > 5:
    print("greater than 5")
elif last_digit == 0:
    print("0")
else:
    print("less than 6 and not 0")
# Output:
# Last digit of 4205 is 5 and is less than 6 and not 0
# Last digit of -626 is -6 and is less than 6 and not 0
# Last digit of 5247 is 7 and is greater than 5
```

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game üî§
- Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line:
  - Use only one `print` function with string format
  - Use only one loop in your code
  - You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
  - You are not allowed to import any module

#### Example:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
for i in range(97, 123):
    print("{}".format(chr(i)), end="")
# Output: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off üç≤
- Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line:

  - You can only use one `print` function with string format
  - You can only use one loop in your code
  - You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
  - You are not allowed to import any module

#### Example:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
for i in range(97, 123):
    if chr(i) != 'q' and chr(i) != 'e':
        print("{}".format(chr(i)), end="")
# Output: abcdfghijklmnoprstuvwxyz
```

### 4. Hexadecimal printing üî¢
- Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example):
  - You can only use one `print` function with string format
  - You can only use one loop in your code
  - You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
  - You are not allowed to import any module

#### Example:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
for i in range(99):
    print("{} = {}".format(i, hex(i)))
# Output:
# 0 = 0x0
# 1 = 0x1
# 2 = 0x2
# ...
# 98 = 0x62
```

### 5. 00...99 üî¢

  - Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
  - Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits

        print("{:02d}, ".format(i), end="")
    else:
        print("{:02d}".format(i))
# Output:
# 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99
