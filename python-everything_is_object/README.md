# 🚀 Python - Everything is Object 🚀

## 📚 Introduction
In this project, I explore the fascinating concept of objects in Python. In Python, everything is an object! This repository contains exercises that helped me understand Python's object model, memory management, and behavior.

## 🧩 Project Overview
Through a series of questions and exercises, I addressed:
- Python's object-oriented nature
- Object identity vs equality
- Immutable vs mutable objects
- Variable assignment and reference
- Memory management in Python

## 📋 Files and Their Purpose
- `*-answer.txt`: Files containing my answers to conceptual questions about Python objects
- `19-copy_list.py`: A function I wrote that returns a copy of a list

## 🔍 Key Concepts Explored
- Object types and identities
- Memory management and garbage collection
- Variable aliasing and cloning
- Immutable data types (int, float, bool, str, tuple)
- Mutable data types (list, dict, set)

## 🛠️ How to Use
These files are primarily for educational purposes and represent my work on this project.

## ✨ What I Learned
By completing this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:
- How Python treats different objects in memory
- The difference between mutable and immutable objects
- How assignment works in Python
- The concepts of shallow and deep copying
