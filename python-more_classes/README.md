## Requirements ‚úÖ
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks üìã
### 0. Simple rectangle
- Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
  - You are not allowed to import any module

### 1. Real definition of a rectangle
- Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
  - Private instance attribute: width
  - Private instance attribute: height
  - Instantiation with optional width and height

### 2. Area and Perimeter
- Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
  - Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the rectangle area
  - Public instance method: def perimeter(self): that returns the rectangle perimeter

### 3. String representation
- Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
  - print() and str() should print the rectangle with the character #

### 4. Eval is magic
- Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
  - repr() should return a string representation of the rectangle to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval()

### 5. Detect instance deletion
- Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
  - Print the message Bye rectangle... when an instance of Rectangle is deleted

### 6. How many instances
- Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
  - Public class attribute number_of_instances

### 7. Change representation
- Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
  - Public class attribute print_symbol

### 8. Compare rectangles
- Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
  - Static method def bigger_or_equal(rect_1, rect_2): that returns the biggest rectangle based on the area

### 9. A square is a rectangle
- Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by:
  - Class method def square(cls, size=0): that returns a new Rectangle instance with width == height == size
